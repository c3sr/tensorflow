	//      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"

	//      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
	//      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
	//  (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
	//      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the

	//      read-modify-write on the same resource.

	// OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current

	//
	// There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and
