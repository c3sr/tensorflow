# builtin_models

This folder contains all the built-in model manifests.
The models are collected from [TensorFlow Models}(https://github.com/tensorflow/models).

## How to Add a Model

No code is required to add a new model.

## Update the Built-in Model Catalog

After updating model manifests or adding new model manifests, run `make generate` in `TensorFlow` or `make generate-tensorflow` in the root `TensorFlow` (`..`).
